Fishing Game Idea

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                                              
                                              
Once...
Upon...
A Time....
A nerd wanted to make a game
A great game that people would play
and somehow KNOW that it's okay to have fun
it's okay to get really deep into something
BUT!
To do that the nerd needed something elusive
Something very, very RARE
The nerd needed a story
Because without a story
the nerd had nothing
no idea, meant no game
and without a story
what was the point :(

what's the point in anything?
then one day



Catch 3 FISH!

                              /

          



                        
Great Job
See that's all it took to feel like you accomplished something



but that's not a story.
    
                            
The story has to be deeper.
You can't JUST have game mechanics! You NEED A STORY.
AAahhh, but alas, the nerd still could not think of a story.
You see, it wasn't that the nerd didn't have an interesting life
Lots of things had happened to the nerd.
Some of those things might be deemed interesting enough by
some other nerd,
or something.
Like....

That one time
When the nerd went Fishing




CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!!


GREAT JOB
See that was fun
Or, at least....
hopefully it was.
Honestly I'm not sure because I've thought about this quite a lot
and there's a certain point when you think about something so much
that you sort of forget some of the basics
like that a game is supposed to be fun
you might have forgotten that
and maybe forgotten that about life too
sometimes
but you're trying to remember all the time
and maybe that's why your games haven't been a hit.
a hit? Who am I kidding.
That's hilarious.
That is doubt
that is time
pressing down on your spirit


o o



CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!



GREAT JOB
seriously, good job.
you've played the game long enough now that I can
reveal the true nature of the game
that there IS IN FACT A STORY
Yes, there has been a story the whole time
transpiring right before your very eyes and you were
soooo oblivious to its GENIUS
THAT'S RIGHT NERDS and BIRDS
GENIUS
the big one
There is a story
It's just that it is also about catching 3 fish.
Never more.
Never less.
The Game is designed that way.
thems the rules.
Because it's just about surviving
one day at a time
and making the game is the only way to do that
each
day
at
a
time
a horror survival game
making the game
or thinking about it
not sure what else to do


CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!



GREAT JOB!
It's time for the true story
The story I've hinted at
and left untold...
I have my reasons.
But it is time.
It is time you knew the truth.
You see, the story in this game
It is one of lonely nerd
a nerd that, though highly intelligent,
like probably intelligence score of 18,
strength score is probably about 11,
but dexterity is high, probably
not as high as it used to be though
I mean, to be honest, it's likely about 8 or 9
if this was a seriously situation where barbarians were
raiding my village, I'd be in trouble
I'd run, jump, whatever, but I'm guessing I am going to be wheezing a bit faster
than those barbarians, given that I am me in that dimension or whatever
Therefore, my point being,
we need the true story
so as I was saying, the story



CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!

Great job
Sorry about last time
seriously, I took advantage and kind of cheated my way into that last round
I owe you the story
the real story is what I promised
The story is simple
It's that given enough time
a nerd has to recreate the world
lots of them
because when your imagination is big
you fill it
and you fill it
and you fill it
The story is a nerd made a game about fishing
LURED you in
And now your in
deep too
Don't quit
This will pay off in the end
because though I cheated a little in luring you in
I only did it because I have good things to show you
I tricked you for your own good


CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!


GREAT JOB
I lied.
there is no story
there's not even a game
and likely, nobody is even reading to this point
BLAH BLHA JSFSJBLAH
Can say whatever I want
BLAHS HF 
nobody here
unless...
maybe you are.
I appologize again.
It's the doubt.
I've been selfish. I haven't even asked your name.
ENTER YOUR NAME:
Ah so your name is <player_name>?
Nice to meet you, <player_name>
Do you want to know my name? (Y / N)



CATCH 3 FISH!!!!!

GREAT JOB

I think it's time you knew that the story
was me telling you this story
about making the game
tricking you into playing it
complaining a bit along the way
sorry about that
The resolution?
don't let doubts hold you back
do what you love
be imaginative
who knows really?
With games, you don't really need a story

It's just better when there is one.
The END
